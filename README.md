Vidar is an open-source end-to-end encrypted SMS application utilizing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES256) to send symmetrically encrypted messages. 
Unlike most messaging apps, Vidar operates entirely over SMS; this eliminates the need for internet access or external servers. As long as there's a cellular signal, your messages go through.

With Vidar you can keep your private conversations private; free from snooping governments and malicious actors.

Why? Because privacy is a fundamental human right and it should be respected as such.
